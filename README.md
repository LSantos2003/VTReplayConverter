## Download Instructions
- Download Tacview first! The version from their [website](https://www.tacview.net/product/about/en/) is highly reocmmended. Since it lets you open multiple Tacview windows at once. However there is a [steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174860/Tacview/) as well. Which only lets you open one tacview file at a time
- Download and run VTRC_Installer.exe from the latest [release](https://github.com/LSantos2003/VTReplayConverter/releases)
- Once VTRC is installed, uninstall the VTRC_Installer since it is no longer needed
